They just stop returning calls.I message and message,hope they’ll respond.Then occasionally they might say something with a single emoji then vanish again.
They never answer their phone—we used to hang out every Saturday night,cook with their families.
Now I boil a large pot of rice on Sundayto last me through the week.I go to work.Those people see a happy, functioning person.
They don’t smell the rot onderneath underneath.
