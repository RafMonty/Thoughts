They just stop returning calls. I message and message, hoping they’ll respond. Then occasionally they might say something with a single emoji, then vanish again.
They never answer their phone—we used to hang out every Saturday night,cook with their families.
Now I boil a large pot of rice on Sunday to last me through the week. I go to work. Those people, paid to know me, see a happy, functioning person.
They don’t smell the rot underneath.
