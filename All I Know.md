Went to the doctor, told him my life, he said “wow that’s rough”
Well I presume it is, I’ve not known any different.
I’ve not known a life without grotesque, shocking, purulent thoughts.
I’ve not known a day without a detailed suicide plan.
I’ve not known a day where I’m not backed into a corner.
I’ve not known a day without everyone’s accusing stares and thoughts.
I’ve not known a day without those around and close to me conspiring to remove me.
I’ve not known a day where I’m so lonely it burns
I’ve not known a day so shameful I want to run and hide
I’ve not known a day I don’t live in fear of being exposed as a fake
I’ve not known any different.
So how can I feel any other way
‘all I do is carry on with all I know
