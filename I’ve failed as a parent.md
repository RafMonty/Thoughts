I’ve failed as a parent. I hear him stumbling and stomping and yelling at nothing Stoned and drunk and not in control.
I’ve failed as a parent. I am now privy to every small sound as the banging continues.
I’ve failed as a parent. He makes no sense. I ask him to leave as I’ve done time and time before.
I’ve failed him as a parent. I drag him out. He resists in false swipes at me and connects.
On the ground, I plead for him to leave. I’ve failed as a parent. He wants to help. I tell him no.
I’ve failed as a parent… I’ve failed as a human.
