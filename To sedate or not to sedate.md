To sedate myself or kill myself, that is the question.
Is it nobler to exist in this hell hole for others’ sake,
Or ease this pain I burden alone?
To sleep, to finally sleep and deaden these thoughts,
Without the weight of waking up again—
But in that chemical sleep
No dreams will come when I’ve dulled every sense,
Its numbness will not linger—there’s the catch.
For in sedation’s fog, life slips like warmed pitch,
All moments lost to the comfortable haze.
And again I swallow pills, in isolation, and call it living.
