question.
Is it noble to exist in this hell hole for the benefit of others or ease my pain which I burden alone?
To sleep, to finally sleep and deaden these thoughts,
Without the weight of waking up again,
That’s the appeal. But in that chemical sleep
No dreams will come when I’ve dulled every sense,
Its numbness will not linger there’s the catch.
For in sedation’s fog, what life slips warms like pitch,
Painful moments lost to the comfortable haze?
